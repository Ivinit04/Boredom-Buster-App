# Boredom-Buster-App
 A web application that offers users a way to combat boredom by providing random activities or allowing them to filter activities based on specific criteria.
 
 The project uses the "https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/" API to fetch activity data. This API provides a variety of leisure activities that users can engage in when they are feeling bored. 
 
 When a user visits the home page, a random activity is fetched from the API and displayed. 
 
 Users can also submit a form on the website to filter activities based on two criteria: type and the number of participants. This allows users to find activities that match their preferences or group size.
